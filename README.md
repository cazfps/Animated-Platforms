# Animated Platforms

An animated ground plane for Blockbench to preview motion (walk cycles, vehicles, etc.) by scrolling a textured plane under your model.

This is especially useful for Minecraft mobs / entity animation, but it works for any animation workflow.

## Features
- Scroll speed in blocks/sec (with quick presets)
- Size/placement controls (width/length/height, rotation)
- Optional custom texture + rotate/flip
- Texture library for quick reuse
- Per-animation presets (save / auto-save)

## Notes
- Custom texture rotation is visual only; movement direction stays consistent.
- Presets are stored locally (Blockbench localStorage) and are scoped so different projects/animations don’t overwrite each other.
